## Widget
- modified widget
The modified widget code is in the scripts.js file.
- unfinished jQuery UI widget is in the datepicker.js file.
## Bugs
- When switching in different tabs, the modified date picker is probably staying at the condition picked last time.
- Even though I added mini zone to expand the contact area, mouse move from menu to submenu may still not effcient enough.
